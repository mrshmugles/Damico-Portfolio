# Analyzing Childcare Prices  

## Overview  
This project examines the **cost of childcare across the United States**, using data from the **National Database of Childcare Prices**. The analysis focuses on **regional variations, trends over time, and economic impacts** to better understand how childcare expenses influence families and policymakers.  

## Data  
The dataset contains **childcare price information from multiple states and years**, including:  
- **UNR_16** – Urban Non-Relative Childcare Cost (2016)  
- **FUNR_16** – Family and Relative Non-Relative Childcare Cost (2016)  
- **MUNR_16** – Mixed Non-Relative Childcare Cost (2016)  
- **Study Year** – Year of data collection  
- **State & County Information** – Geographic identifiers for regional analysis  

The data was cleaned and processed to remove inconsistencies and ensure accurate analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Canva  
- **Big Data Processing**: PySpark  

## Project Workflow  
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Loaded data from the **National Database of Childcare Prices**  
- Identified and handled **missing values**  
- Converted key variables to appropriate formats  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Analyzed trends in childcare costs over time**  
- **Compared childcare expenses across states**  
- **Evaluated differences in costs for single-parent vs. two-parent households**  

### 3. Visualizations & Insights  
- **Pie Chart**: Single-parent vs. two-parent household distribution  
- **Line Graph**: Trends in childcare costs over time  
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Comparison of childcare costs by state  
- **Choropleth Map**: Highlighting states with the highest childcare expenses  

### 4. Findings  
- **Childcare costs vary significantly by state**, with urban areas experiencing higher prices  
- **Single-parent households face greater financial challenges**, highlighting the need for targeted support  
- **Costs have increased over time**, influencing family budgets and economic policies  

## Future Improvements  
- Expand analysis to include **additional economic factors (income levels, inflation, subsidies)**  
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** for real-time childcare cost tracking  
- Incorporate **predictive modeling** to forecast future childcare expenses
