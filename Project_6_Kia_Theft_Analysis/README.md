# Kia Theft Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes **Kia and Hyundai vehicle theft trends** across major U.S. cities, focusing on identifying **patterns, high-risk areas, and the impact of security vulnerabilities** in these car models. The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** to vehicle designers and engineers to improve security features and mitigate theft risks.  

## Data  
The dataset includes **vehicle theft records** across multiple years, with key attributes such as:  
- **City & State** – Location of reported thefts  
- **Vehicle Type** – Kia vs. Hyundai theft counts  
- **Time Series Data** – Theft trends by **year and month**  
- **Regional Insights** – Theft distribution across different U.S. cities  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Folium (for mapping theft locations)  

## Project Workflow  
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Loaded **theft data** and filtered relevant features  
- Handled **missing values** and formatted time-based records for analysis  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **City-wise Theft Distribution** – Identified the **top cities** with the highest theft counts (Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore)  
- **Kia vs. Hyundai Theft Comparison** – Analyzed trends showing **Hyundai vehicles being more frequently stolen than Kias**  
- **Time-Series Analysis** – Showcased a **massive surge in vehicle thefts starting in 2021**  

### 3. Visualizations & Insights  
- **Pie Chart & Tree Map**: Breakdown of thefts by city  
- **Bar Charts**: Kia vs. Hyundai theft comparison  
- **Line Graphs**: Theft trends over time  
- **Heatmaps**: Regional concentration of theft activity  

### 4. Findings  
- **Theft rates surged in 2021 and 2022**, correlating with security vulnerabilities in certain Kia and Hyundai models  
- **Hyundais were stolen at a significantly higher rate** than Kias, highlighting brand-specific risks  
- **Theft hotspots** are concentrated in **major metropolitan areas**, requiring enhanced security measures  

## Future Improvements  
- Integrate **law enforcement & insurance claim data** for deeper insights  
- Implement **machine learning models** to predict high-risk areas  
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** for real-time vehicle theft tracking
